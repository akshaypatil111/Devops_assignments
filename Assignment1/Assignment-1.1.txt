In this Assignment  we will cover some basic command of linux
- First check your current working directory
> pwd 

- Now create directory with name "linux" in your current directory.
> mkdir linux

- Then create a another directory  with name "Assignment-01" inside your "linux" directory  .
> mkdir linux/Assignment-01

- Now create one more directory inside "/tmp" with name "dir1" without changing your present directory.
> mkdir /tmp/dir1

- At last create two more directories having below tree structure .It should create a below structure via single command only .
```
/tmp
  - dir1
      - dir2
        - dir3
```

> mkdir -p /tmp/dir1/dir2/dir3

- Find a command  that will delete a "dir3" that you have created before.
> rmdir /tmp/dir1/dir2/dir3

- Now create a empty file with your "firt-name"  in /tmp directory.
> touch /tmp/first-name

- After creating a empty file , add "This is my first line " into a file without using any editor.
> echo "This is my first-name" > /tmp/first-name

- Now add  one more line "this is a additional content " into a same file .Make sure it will not overwrite the previous line of the file.
> echo "this his is addition content" > /tmp/first-name

- Then  create new  file with your  "last-name" along with some content like "last-name is my last name".Do not use any editor
> echo "last-name is my last name" > /tmp/last-name

- Now add "this is line at the  beginning" into "last-name" file  in such a manner that it will add the line at beginning of the file.Do not use any editor.
> echo "this is line at the beginning" | cat - /tmp/last-name > temp && mv temp /tmp/last-name

- Then add some more 8-10  lines to the same file .
> cat << EOF >> /tmp/last-name
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
EOF

- Now find a command that will show:
  - top 5 lines of the file.
  > head -n 5 /tmp/last-name
  - bottom 2 lines of the  file.
  >tail -n 2 /tmp/last-name
  
  - only 6th line  of the file.
  > head -n 6 /tmp/last-name | tail -n 1
  
  - 3-8 lines of the file .
  > head -n 8 /tmp/last-name | tail -n 6
  
- Find a command that will list  below things of /tmp directory
  - list all content(including hidden files)
  > ls -a /tmp
  
  - list only files
  > ls -p /tmp | grep -v / 
  
  - list only directories
  > ls -p /tmp | grep /
  
- Now copy the "last-name" into the /tmp/dir2 with same name.
> cp /tmp/last-name /tmp/dir1/dir2/

- Then again copy the "last-name" into the /tmp/dir2, this time with different name i.e "last-name".copy
>cp /tmp/last-name /tmp/dir1/dir2/last-name.copy

- Now change the name of the "first-name" file  to some other name at same location .
>mv /tmp/first-name /tmp/new-name

- Find a command that will  move the "last-name" file  to /tmp/dir1
> mv /tmp/last-name /tmp/dir1

- find a command that will clear the content of /tmp/dir2/"last-name".copy .Make sure it will not even contain  empty line .
>echo -n > /tmp/dir1/dir2/last-name.copy

- Now delete the same file i.e /tmp/dir2/last-name.copy
>rm /tmp/dir1/dir2/last-name.copy



Note : Do not use sed command in this assignment.
